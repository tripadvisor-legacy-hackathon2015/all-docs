### API keys for deCODE hackathon (these will be revoked following the weekend)

#### Rules
* Please do not start burning through API data before the hackathon starts; we 
will explain rules and a bit of background at deCODE 2015.

* Please be careful not to accidentally call the api hundreds of times from 
a loop. Once the daily call limit on a key is reached, we cannot reset it.

* We cannot retain any API data; we will destroy our indices / cached data at the end of the workshop. However, we'll take plenty of screenshots of what we build!
